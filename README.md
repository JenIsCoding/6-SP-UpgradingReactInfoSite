**Upgrade the React Info Site with the choice between Light and Dark mode**

*Concepts*: To complete this project the use of `useState` was crucial; I've also tasted the conditional CSS interaction between .jsx files and CSS in React and I think that the use of the conditional ternary operators - very easy and simple to use within one or two elements - to determine the style based on the `useState` update could become difficult to manage in case we would have many elements on the page to style!!
